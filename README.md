## Contributor Information

### General Functionality
This tool works by pulling mods from the dwarf fortress mods folder, and pulling modpacks from the dfhack config mod-manager.json.
ModReferences are generated from found mod folders, while modpacks are generated from the dfhack config.
Loading modpacks into the game is done via altering mod-manager.json and using dfhacks normal mod management once the game loads.

### Term Definitions
#### DFHMod
DFHack only deals with mod name and mod version. This is all that's saved and loaded.
These are set up to act like a value type.  

#### ModReference
A more comprehensive object storing more information about mods, mostly for displaying. Is not saved.
Can easily be converted to a DFHMod.

#### DFHModPack
An object representing a modpack matching how DFHack handles them. Only has a name, a bool default, and a list of DFHMods.
DFHack stores a list of these in a json file, which it loads into the game.
